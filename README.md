ðŸ‘‹ Hello, fellow cosmic traveler! I'm [Sourav], a passionate radio and optical astronomer, and I specialize in unraveling the mysteries of the universe using data and code.

ðŸŒŸ Here's a glimpse of my cosmic toolkit:
   - ðŸ”­ Radio Astronomy: Unveiling the secrets of the universe in radio wavelengths.
   - ðŸ”¬ Optical Astronomy: Studying the cosmos through the lens of visible light.
   - ðŸ“Š Data Analysis: Harnessing the power of data to decipher astronomical phenomena.
   - ðŸŒŒ Astrophysical Simulations: Modeling the cosmos with a pinch of physics.
   - ðŸ“· Optical Photometry: Capturing the light from distant stars and galaxies.

ðŸ“¡ My research journey has led me to fascinating corners of the universe, from galaxies to Dark matter far, far away. I've dived deep into [Radio Astronomy and Galaxy Morphologies ], and I'm always hungry for new cosmic puzzles.

ðŸŒŒ When I'm not gazing at the night sky or crunching numbers, you might find me sharing my cosmic insights in research papers, enjoying a good sci-fi novel, or taking long hikes to ponder the vastness of space.

ðŸŒ  Let's connect and explore the cosmos together:
